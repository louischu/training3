## Day 1
### Git: Github/bitbucket
### Java Core:
  - Semantics: Condition control, for loop , java version
  - String, Array
  - Java Collection
    => LIST/SET/MAP/Queue
        => LIST: ArrayList, LinkedList -> store random access value, compare between
        => Set: HashSet, TreeSet -> store unique value
        => Map: HashMap
        => PriorityQueue
        => Concurrent:
            -> Blocking Queue
            ->
  - Java IO
  - Java Multi Threading
  - Java OOP
### Introduce DSA
  - Data structure: List, Array, String
        => Insert, insert at index, insert last, delete, traverse, get at index
        => Sorting
        => Reverse
  - Sorting (learn to known, but almost use Java Collections framework)
  - Two pointers
  - Binary search
  - DFS
  - Backtracking
  - BFS
  - Dynamic Programming
